##Tank Commander##

Tank Commander is an aquarium controller for the Arduino platform.  This is a pet project (get it) so some design decisions may be based off of what components I already have.  

###Current Features###
- Tank Temperauture
- Ambient Temperature

###Planned Features###
- PWM LED control
- Heater control
- General Purpose outlet control
- IR input
- Float switch input
- Some kind of web-based control and data logging

###Major Components###
- Arduino Uno
- DS18B20 (used for aquarium temperature)
- LM35 Temperature Sensor (used for ambient temperature)
- 16x2 LCD Display
